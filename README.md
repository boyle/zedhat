# zedhat ẑ  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/boyle/zedhat.svg?token=ppJxXrcSY7ZkfdM9JuFM&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/boyle/zedhat)
A tool for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT).
Current is applied to electrodes on the boundary and voltages are measured at other electrodes.
From the measured voltages, we reconstruct an estimate of the conductivity ẑ over the interior.
