Immediate Work
2016-07-29 consume matrices from EIDORS, solve 1-step GN inv
2017-04-05 out of tree build check fails: "mkdir tmp && cd tmp && ../configure && make check"

Long-term Acceptance Criteria
 1. compiles on all systems (windows, linux, osx)
 2. long-term supportable (minimize dependencies)
 3. clean library bindings (dynamic & static):
    - matlab,
    - python,
    - C (native)
    - C++ (native)
 4. a "simple interface" as well as giving access
    to the core functionality (kernels)
      simple:  meas + model + config --> img
      kernels: solve(meas, model, config, &img)
 5. cmdline: shell call simple interface
 6. gui: python(?) call simple interface, visualize
 7. export run data package (input/state/outputs) .mat(?)
    for exactly repeatable results (version compatibility)
