Immediate Work
2016-06-22 tests to confirm libmatio behaviour

Long-term Acceptance Criteria
 1. Must compile on all systems (windows, linux, osx)
 2. Must have bindings to:
    - matlab,
    - python
 3. Must be long-term supportable (minimize dependencies)
 4. Must have a "simple interface" as well as giving access
    to the core functionality (kernels).
